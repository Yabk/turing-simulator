# Turing Simulator

Simple CLI Turing machine simulator written in python3.

## Getting Started

To run the simulator use simulator-cli.py with one argument containing the name of the program you want to run.
I made 2 example programs that you can try: increment-binary.txt and increment-decimal.txt
```
./simulator-cli.py increment-binary.txt
```
Once the simulator starts, going to next step is done by pressing enter. You can enter 'q' if you want to quit before the program ends.

## Writing your own program

You can write your own programs by following the format of example programs.
